# LotteryGame
This program asks user for set of numbers and then compares it to ones chosen at random. This will be repeated until there is a full match. Afterwards the program tells you how many years it took and if the amount is 120 or larger it will try again.
# Usage
The program simply asks your numbers at the start. If you try to give numbers that are out of range or already given, you will be asked to give another one. Alternatively you can give your numbers as parameters. If you give wrong amount of parameters or they don't fit in the range, the program will move on to ask them as normal
